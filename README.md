I'm an aspiring developer looking to master various programming languages and create a project in each. Welcome to my code corner,
where I document my progress, share experiences, and track achievements.

## Goal
My main goal is to explore various programming languages, expand my technical toolkit, and build interesting projects for practice and learning.

That's why I came up with a challenge for myself: a project in each of the languages that interest me (or you).

## What languages i will use?
I just opened GitHub's rating of languages and sorted it by stars. So i got 50 most *starred??* programming languages.

## Progress

**6/50**
